title: "Centre for experimentation with digital methods in Social Sciences and Humanities"


---
CERES is the Centre for experimentation with digital methods in Social Sciences and Humanities, hosted by the Facult√© des Lettres at Sorbonne University since 2021. The Centre provides support to researchers and students whose projects rely on the use of digital methods in the field of Social Sciences and Humanities.

This support focuses on 3 main areas : 
- Digital methods and tools for studying social platforms, Internet and digital environments
- Methods and tools for digitising historical sources and studying digitised heritage
- A transversal infrastructure dedicated to manage both the diversity of multisemiotic data and the analytical work

CERES provides a technical and methodological support by promoting the use of existing tools (pages in FR) and creating new methods and their dedicated tools (page in FR). The Centre has built a strong epistemological framework about digital methods, especially by theorizing the relation between the interpretative work of researchers and the use of new interfaces and digital tools. More broadly, the Centre works toward the development of interdisciplinary practices in science, starting with its own interdisciplinary team.
